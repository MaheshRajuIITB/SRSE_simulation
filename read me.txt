#20250204_SRSE_multiple_GSAs 
	--- Multiple attacks (0 to 5 PMUs are spoofed) in the System.
	--- Percentage of Multiple attacks (0% to 100% PMUs are spoofed) in the System.  

#20250228_PA_Chi_inadequency_ang_variation
	---To check the performance of PA and Chi-square test for correct, inadequate weights and unit (without) weights.
	---These values are calculated for angles varying between 0:0.1:10 and inadequate weights are changing based error introduced.

#20250303_PA_Chi_inadequacy_ang_vary_baise_error
	---To check the performance of PA and Chi-square test with adding bias error for correct, inadequate weights and unit (without) weights.
	---These values are calculated for angles varying between 0:0.1:10 and inadequate weights are changing based error introduced.
	--- Baise error in Magnitude and Phase angle based on Pragati Madam's paper. This error is introduced in 3 PMUs. 

#20250313_SRSE_with_baise_error
	---To check the performance of PA and Chi-square test with adding bias error for correct, inadequate weights and unit (without) weights.
	---Baise error in Magnitude and Phase angle based on Pragati Madam's paper. This error is introduced in 3 PMUs. 
	---Here there is no spoofing angle variation.
