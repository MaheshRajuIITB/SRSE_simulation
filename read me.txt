#20250204_SRSE_multiple_GSAs 
	--- Multiple attacks (0 to 5 PMUs are spoofed) in the System.
	--- Percentage of Multiple attacks (0% to 100% PMUs are spoofed) in the System.  

#20250228_PA_Chi_inadequency_ang_variation
	---To check the performance of PA and Chi-square test for correct, inadequate weights and unit (without) weights.
	---These values are calculated for angles varying between 0:0.1:10 and inadequate weights are changing based error introduced.

#20250303_PA_Chi_inadequacy_ang_vary_baise_error
	---To check the performance of PA and Chi-square test with adding bias error for correct, inadequate weights and unit (without) weights.
	---These values are calculated for angles varying between 0:0.1:10 and inadequate weights are changing based error introduced.
	--- Baise error in Magnitude and Phase angle based on Pragati Madam's paper. This error is introduced in 3 PMUs. 

#20250313_SRSE_with_baise_error
	---To check the performance of PA and Chi-square test with adding bias error for correct, inadequate weights and unit (without) weights.
	---Baise error in Magnitude and Phase angle based on Pragati Madam's paper. This error is introduced in 3 PMUs. 
	---Here there is no spoofing angle variation.

#20250318_SRSE_distrubted_SE
	---Applying PA test in distributed parts of the entire test system.

#20250326_SRSE_algorithm
	---Complete algorithm of Spoofing Resilient State Estimation.
	---This file is designed only for one case at a time with 1000 monte simulations.
	---Need to mentioned the number of poistions of spoofed PMUs along with spoofing angles.
	---This quite similar to real time algorithm.

#20250409_SRSE_algorithm_Single_GSA_fixed_spf_ang
	---Spoofing one PMU at one time with fixed spoofingle angle for 1000 monte carlo simulations. 

#20250416_SRSE_with_FDIA
	---Response of SRSE algorithm when false data is introduced in measurements.

#20250417_SRSE_ang_var_-1to1
	---One PMU is spooofed with the spoofing angle varying from -1to1 deg.
	---All PMUs in 30 bus system and selected 13 PMUs in 118 bus system.
	---Fig.4: (System principal angle as a function of spoofing angle for IEEE 30 and IEEE 118 bus systems. The principal angle with spoofing is shown in red color, and after mitigation of GSA, it is shown in black color. The threshold value of PA is $0.1443^\circ$ for \hbox{IEEE 30} and $0.1107^\circ$ for \hbox{IEEE 118}.) and Fig.5: (Variation of RMSE of states with GSA and after mitigation of GSA for IEEE 30 and 	118 bus systems. RMSE with spoofing is shown in red color and after mitigation of GSA it is shown in black color.) in SRSE Paper are obtained from this simulation file only.
