This folder contains the values of Chi square and PA with correct, unit and inadequate weights for different standard deviations before correction algorithm.
SD1 = 0.001 for voltage 0.002 for current;
SD2 = 0.005 for voltage 0.01 for current;
SD3 = 0.01 for voltage 0.02 for current.

Threshold_Calculation - file is to calculate threshold values of Chi and PA for different cases. The values are given in the excel file named: Threshold values for IEEE 30 and IEEE 118 bus systems.

Plot_before_SRSE - file is for comprasion of chi for different standard deviation and same for PA. Also comparision plot of Chi and PA for SD1
